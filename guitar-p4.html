        <ol>
          <li><strong>Pick a key</strong> &mdash; Click any wedge on the Circle of Fifths to choose your root note.</li>
          <li><strong>Choose a mode</strong> &mdash; Select one of the seven modes. The app defaults to Ionian (major scale).</li>
          <li><strong>Explore the scale</strong> &mdash; The scale notes appear in the info panel. Click any note to hear it. The root note is highlighted in red.</li>
          <li><strong>Play chords</strong> &mdash; The diatonic chords for your key and mode are shown with Roman numerals. Click a chord card to hear its notes played as a short arpeggio.</li>
          <li><strong>Use the fretboard</strong> &mdash; The guitar neck shows 15 frets in all-fourths tuning (E A D G C F). Scale tones are highlighted and labeled; the root note gets a stronger highlight. Click or tap any position to hear it.</li>

      <summary class="guide-heading">All Fourths Tuning</summary>
      <div class="guide-content">
        <p><strong>All-fourths tuning</strong> (also called P4 tuning) tunes every string a perfect fourth apart: <strong>E A D G C F</strong> (low to high).</p>
        <p>Standard tuning is <em>almost</em> all fourths &mdash; E A D G B E &mdash; but the interval between the 3rd (G) and 2nd (B) strings is a major third instead of a fourth. All-fourths tuning removes that exception, making the interval uniform across all six strings.</p>
        <h4>Advantages</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Uniform patterns</strong> &mdash; Every scale shape, arpeggio, and chord voicing works identically on every pair of adjacent strings. Learn a pattern once and move it anywhere on the neck without adjustment.</li>
          <li><strong>Easier transposition</strong> &mdash; Shift any shape up or down the neck, or across string groups, and it stays correct. No more memorizing separate shapes for the B-string offset.</li>
          <li><strong>Simpler intervals</strong> &mdash; Interval geometry is consistent: an octave is always two strings up and two frets over, a fifth is always one string up and two frets over, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Trade-offs</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Standard chord voicings change</strong> &mdash; Open chords and barre chords from standard tuning no longer apply on the top two strings. Many familiar shapes need reworking.</li>
          <li><strong>Slightly higher top strings</strong> &mdash; The 1st string is an F instead of an E, one semitone higher in tension. Some players use a lighter gauge on top.</li>
          <li><strong>Less learning material</strong> &mdash; Most guitar instruction assumes standard tuning, so you'll be translating or figuring things out on your own.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Comparison to Standard</h4>
        <table class="tuning-table">
          <thead>
            <tr><th>String</th><th>Standard</th><th>All Fourths</th><th>Difference</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>6th (low)</td><td>E</td><td>E</td><td>Same</td></tr>
            <tr><td>5th</td><td>A</td><td>A</td><td>Same</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4th</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>Same</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3rd</td><td>G</td><td>G</td><td>Same</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2nd</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>+1 semitone</td></tr>
            <tr><td>1st (high)</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>+1 semitone</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Players like Stanley Jordan and Tom Quayle are well-known advocates of all-fourths tuning. It's particularly popular among jazz and fusion guitarists who value the symmetry for improvisation.</p>

      <summary class="guide-heading">The Circle of Fifths</summary>
      <div class="guide-content">
        <p>The <strong>Circle of Fifths</strong> arranges all twelve musical keys so that each one is a perfect fifth (seven semitones) above the previous. Moving clockwise adds one sharp; moving counter-clockwise adds one flat.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clockwise (sharps):</strong> C &rarr; G &rarr; D &rarr; A &rarr; E &rarr; B &rarr; F#</li>
          <li><strong>Counter-clockwise (flats):</strong> C &rarr; F &rarr; Bb &rarr; Eb &rarr; Ab &rarr; Db &rarr; Gb</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Adjacent keys on the circle share most of their notes, which makes them natural choices for key changes. For example, C major and G major differ by only one note (F vs F#). This is why the circle is so useful for songwriting and improvisation&mdash;it maps harmonic distance.</p>

      <summary class="guide-heading">Understanding Modes</summary>
      <div class="guide-content">
        <p>Modes are seven different scales you can build from the same set of notes by starting on a different degree. Each mode has a distinct mood or color:</p>
        <dl class="mode-descriptions">
          <dt>Ionian (Major)</dt>
          <dd>The familiar major scale. Bright, happy, resolved. <em>Think: "Happy Birthday," most pop music.</em></dd>

          <dt>Dorian</dt>
          <dd>A minor scale with a raised 6th. Jazzy, smooth, sophisticated. <em>Think: "So What" by Miles Davis, funk and soul.</em></dd>

          <dt>Phrygian</dt>
          <dd>A minor scale with a lowered 2nd. Dark, exotic, Spanish-flavored. <em>Think: flamenco guitar, metal intros.</em></dd>

          <dt>Lydian</dt>
          <dd>A major scale with a raised 4th. Dreamy, floating, ethereal. <em>Think: film scores, "The Simpsons" theme.</em></dd>

          <dt>Mixolydian</dt>
          <dd>A major scale with a lowered 7th. Bluesy, laid-back, dominant. <em>Think: classic rock, blues, "Norwegian Wood."</em></dd>

          <dt>Aeolian (Natural Minor)</dt>
          <dd>The natural minor scale. Sad, serious, introspective. <em>Think: "Losing My Religion," most minor-key pop.</em></dd>

          <dt>Locrian</dt>
          <dd>A minor scale with lowered 2nd and 5th. Unstable, dissonant, tense. <em>Rarely used as a home key; useful for creating tension over diminished chords.</em></dd>
        </dl>
      </div>

    <details class="guide-block">
      <summary class="guide-heading">Diatonic Chords &amp; Roman Numerals</summary>
      <div class="guide-content">
        <p>When you build a triad on each degree of a scale using only notes from that scale, you get the <strong>diatonic chords</strong>. Roman numerals label each chord by its position:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Uppercase (I, IV, V)</strong> = major chord</li>
          <li><strong>Lowercase (ii, iii, vi)</strong> = minor chord</li>
          <li><strong>Lowercase with &deg; (vii&deg;)</strong> = diminished chord</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the key of C Ionian (major), the chords are: <strong>C &ndash; Dm &ndash; Em &ndash; F &ndash; G &ndash; Am &ndash; Bdim</strong>. Common progressions like I&ndash;V&ndash;vi&ndash;IV (C&ndash;G&ndash;Am&ndash;F) come from combining these chords. Each mode rearranges which degrees are major, minor, or diminished, giving you different harmonic palettes to improvise over.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="guide-block">
      <summary class="guide-heading">Reading the Fretboard</summary>
      <div class="guide-content">
        <p>The fretboard is displayed in all-fourths tuning (low E to high F, bottom to top). Fret 0 is the open string, and frets are numbered left to right.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Highlighted dots</strong> show notes that belong to the current scale.</li>
          <li><strong>Red dots</strong> mark the root note &mdash; these are your "home base" positions for the selected key.</li>
          <li><strong>Dot markers</strong> below the fretboard appear at frets 3, 5, 7, 9, 12 (double dot), and 15, just like on a real guitar neck.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because every string pair uses the same interval, any scale pattern you learn can be moved directly to any string group without modification. Look for how the shapes repeat uniformly &mdash; this is the core benefit of P4 tuning.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The 12th fret is one octave above the open string &mdash; the pattern of notes repeats from there. Use this to learn the neck in two halves.</p>
